This program is a shallow implementation of a Ride Sharing Service, where drivers and passengers
can see the location of and distance away from passengers or vehicles on a map.

1) To the best of my knowledge, everything has been correctly implemented.  I am confident in my code's 
   functionality and adherence to the specifications.

2) Thanks to Ming for answering the questions I had regarding this assignment.

Acknowledgements to Nathan Lippi on Stackoverflow for his implementation of the Haversine distance
calculation formula as well, found at this link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript.

3) I spent about ~6 hours on this assignment.
