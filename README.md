1) Purpose?

The purpose of this repository is to hold many of the assignments completed during COMP20 at Tufts University, with Ming Chow. It contains assignments such as notuber, security, and responsive such that we can get experience with Github, and so that Ming can grade our work.


2) Favorite lab or assignment?

Given how tied together all of the assignments are, and how much they build off of each 
other, it's hard to say what my favorite of the labs or assignments is. If I had to choose,
I might say that responsive or notuber were my favorite. Responsive, as simple as it might
seem, was my first experience making a web page that would actually, well, respond to 
what the user was doing on their end, and I found that very cool â€” especially since up to 
that point I had only made completely static pages. 

On the other hand, notuber was very cool because it was the first "substantial" project
I had done using front-end development. It was both interesting, and ilucidating as I navigated
the google maps API, javascript, and html/css.


3) How much have I grown?

Knowledge wise I have grown a lot for sure. A lot of the topics, concepts, and issues that I 
had only vaguely been aware of prior to this class were expanded on greatly. HTML was just 
something that I had dabbled in, I didn't understand CSS, and security, while I was aware of
the seriousness of vulnerabilities in code throughout the world, never reached a point where 
*my* projects needed to put measures in place.

It was also illuminating to learn about "how the internet works." Especially the overview we
did at the end of the semester - "what happens when you type google into the browser and press
enter." This field was always something that was more magic to me than anything else, and now
that I've gotten a chance to peek under the hood, I know now how little I actually know when It comes to the field, and I am appreciative to be able to have a general sense about how
various things work.

Being in the course also makes me appreciate the things taken for granted in other CS courses;
I really like modularity.


4) Most important thing that I learned in this course?

"Important"? This is also something that produces a different answer depending on how you look
at things.

I think the most "important" thing by far was the security overview at the end of the course.
I realize that we did not go nearly as much into it as people probably should in a CS program,
but also recognize that its a web-programming course and not a security course. Although, the 
fact that we *did* go over security so "heavily" in a web programming course just shows the 
pertinence and prevalence of these issues in every other field.

Showing off the cross site scripting really illuminates how something so simple, something so
innocent for a developer to do, can result in dastardly and terrible consequences. While we
only used it to go to 4chan, it is scary how many websites are plagued by this issue, and how
easy it is to fall into the trap.

Seeing the poor programming practices being used in code in the industry is also extremely 
scary. The Tmobile incident that happened in the back end of this course shows that off 
perfectly - and Ming highlighted it well. The ignorance in the field and the carelessness
really is a testament of how much more wary of these things we need to be.

So, security awareness and consciousness is probably the most important thing that I learned
in this class. Learning about its prevalence in computer science, and how you can be
wary of it is something extremely valuable that will only be more relevant as the industry
develops.


5) Delve deeper?

I definitely feel like all the topics in this course are worthy of delving deeper into. While
I think Ming did a good job in selecting topics and presenting the material to us, one must 
admit that it was very broad and perhaps not very deep. Everything we learned in this class
is definitely something that I want to look into more in the future.

If I had to pick out a few, maybe learning to make more dynamic pages would be nice. We did a 
little bit of that, but not as much as to make fancy pages like Amazon or any larger website.

Learning how to use other databases would also be nice - my team's polyhack project earlier 
this year would have really benefited from us knowing how to use mysql, and we are still 
planning to go back to that project and fix it up.

And of course, with security being so important, that is always something to do more reading
in.


Thank you Ming! This has been a great course, and you've been a great teacher.
